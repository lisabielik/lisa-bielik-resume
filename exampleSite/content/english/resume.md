        About me
    </div>
    <div class="custom-expand-content">
        <p>I'm a Senior Technical Writer and Information Architect with nearly 15 years of experience turning complex technical systems into documentation that actually works. I've partnered with fast-growing SaaS, B2B, and open source startups, collaborating directly with product, engineering, and customer success teams to document APIs, SDKs, and platform features that drive real results.</p>
        <p>I build clear, structured documentation that accelerates onboarding, boosts feature adoption, and keeps users moving forward. I work embedded with cross-functional teams to ensure docs stay launch-ready. I'm an expert at scaling documentation systems from the ground up, building workflows and frameworks that grow with the company. I'm a strong advocate for docs-as-product and treating documentation as a strategic asset.</p>
        <p>Fast-paced, agile environments? That's where I thrive.</p>
