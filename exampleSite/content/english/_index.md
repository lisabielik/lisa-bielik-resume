# Hi, there!

I'm so glad you're here.

For nearly 15 years, I've been solving the same problem: how do you explain complex technology in a way that actually helps people?

From help centers and API docs to SOPs and training videos, I work with SaaS, B2B, open source teams to transform complicated products into resources people can actually use. No fluff, no confusion—just clear answers when you need them. And no, AI won't stop me from using the em dash.

**My approach**: clarity over cleverness, scalability over shortcuts, user needs over assumptions.

Aside from technical writing, I enjoy tinkering with front-end web stuff like CSS and React, reading (I'm a HUGE horror and thriller buff!), gardening, and low-effort biking.

I live in Northeast Ohio with my husband, son, golden retriever, pit bull, and cat!
