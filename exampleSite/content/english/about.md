I'm Lisa Bielik, a Northeast Ohio-based documentation specialist, senior technical writer, and experienced technical editor. With over 10 years of experience, I have produced everything from 300-plus page user manuals, to custom-built help centers, to technical marketing materials.

Technical documentation should be engaging and relatable—and as concise as possible. Gone are the days where technical documentation has to be formal and bland. I believe people learn better when the material they're reading is written in plain English. My approach to writing is simple—collect information, test as I write, and consult subject matter experts and/or product managers on all reviews. I'm also a staunch believer in working together with other areas of the business to ensure that all technical materials fully and accurately represent the company's branding and mission.

I'm an avid reader (need a horror/thriller recommendation? let me know!) and I enjoy hanging out with my husband, son, two dogs (pitbull and golden retriever), and cat <3
