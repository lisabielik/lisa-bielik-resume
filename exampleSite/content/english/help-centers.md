I've worked on three major help centers so far. The examples below do not include knowledge bases I've worked on.

- [Turning Technologies](https://help.turningtechnologies.com/) - Built with Madcap Flare (2011 - 2015)

  >**Note**: Documentation has been updated in the years since I created this help center. However, the structure of both the help center and the documentation remains the same as when I originally created it.
 
- [Adblock Plus](https://help.adblockplus.org/hc/en-us) - Built with Markdown, Git (2016 - 2020)

  >**Note**: Since I originally created the help center, it's been transferred to Zendesk. However, many of the articles I wrote, as well as other elements I implemented on the site, remains the same.

- [Hyperproof](https://docs.hyperproof.io) - Built with Markdown, Git, Hugo (2021 - current)
